Pathfinder Program with A Algorithm* 
Welcome to the Pathfinder program, a versatile tool for finding optimal paths using the A* algorithm. 
This repository houses a powerful pathfinding tool that efficiently navigates through obstacles, making it perfect for games, robotics, and simulations.

Features
- A* Algorithm: The program utilizes the A* algorithm, known for its efficiency in finding the shortest path between two points.
- Optimal Paths: Quickly find the best routes through mazes, maps, or grids with this pathfinder.
- Customizable Grids: Easily input custom grids or maps to find paths in various scenarios.

How it Works
- The A* algorithm intelligently explores possible paths, prioritizing those with lower costs, to find the shortest path efficiently.
  Whether it's a maze, game level, or grid-based map, this program will calculate the optimal route.

How to Use
- Left-click to set the starting point
- Left-click to set the endpoint
- Left-click and drag around the area to create obstacles
- Press "C" to clear the grid and start fresh
- Press "Space" to start the program and find the shortest route between the two points
