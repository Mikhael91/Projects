The File Sorter Program is a simple utility designed to organize files within a specified directory based on their file types. This program helps users maintain a clean and structured file system by automatically sorting files into designated folders.

Upon execution, the program scans the target directory, identifies the file types (e.g., .jpg, .docx) or a specified key (e.g., key-filename, key_filename), and moves each file to the corresponding folder. For example, all docx files are moved to the "Words" folder, PDFs to the "Documents" folder, and so on.

Users can customize the program by defining the "key" categories and corresponding folders. This flexibility allows for a personalized organization system tailored to individual needs.

Key Features:
- Automatically sorts files by type into designated folders.
- Customizable "key" categories and destination folders.
- Simple and intuitive user interface.
- Helps maintain an organized file system for improved efficiency and accessibility.
- The File Sorter Program is ideal for users who frequently accumulate a variety of files and want a convenient way to keep their directories tidy and well-structured.
